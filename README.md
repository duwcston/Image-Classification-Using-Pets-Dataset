# Image-Classification-Using-Pets-Dataset
Using pre-trained ResNet50v2 model for multiclass image classification of Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset

## Dataset description

The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset is a 37 category pet dataset with roughly 200 images for each class created by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford. The images have a large variations in scale, pose and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.

Original dataset was downloaded from [https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/).
